Mortality data plays a central role in informing health and demographic statistics. It is used to:

- Monitor public health outcomes and identify trends over time
- Support the planning and delivery of health and social care services
- Allocate resources based on population needs and mortality patterns
- Conduct research into health inequalities, disease burden, and life expectancy
- Produce national and subnational population estimates and projections
- Quality assure census outputs and demographic models
- Report on social and demographic changes
- Provide timely information on public health emergencies (e.g., COVID-19)
- Enable detailed analysis of specific mortality topics, such as drug-related deaths or infant mortality linked to birth characteristics

These applications contribute to both national policy development and international reporting obligations, including **[Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases)** and **[WHO health indicators](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases)**.

## Coverage

Mortality statistics are based on information collected during the death registration process. The data typically includes:

- Demographic details: Age, sex, and usual residence of the deceased
- Event details: Date and place of death
- Medical information: Cause of death, coded using the International Classification of Diseases [(ICD-10 or ICD-11)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases)

The coverage of mortality data is influenced by the legal and administrative framework for death registration. For example, in England and Wales, all deaths must be registered by law, ensuring high completeness.

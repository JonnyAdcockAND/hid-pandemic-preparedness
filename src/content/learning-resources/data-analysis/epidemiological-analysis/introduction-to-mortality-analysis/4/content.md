# Demographic Breakdowns

Mortality data can be grouped by key demographic characteristics to help identify patterns and inequalities across different population subgroups. These groupings include:

- **Age:** Data are commonly presented in single years of age or five-year age bands. Infant deaths are further classified into neonatal (under 28 days) and postneonatal (28 days to under 1 year) categories.
- **Sex:** Mortality statistics are routinely reported separately for males and females.
- **Other characteristics (where available through data linkage):** These may include ethnicity, disability status, and socio-economic classification.

Grouping mortality data by demographic characteristics is essential for understanding how mortality varies across different parts of the population. It helps identify health inequalities, monitor vulnerable groups, and inform targeted public health interventions and policies

# Geographic Coverage

Mortality data can also be analysed across different geographic areas, allowing users to explore differences and local trends.
Geographic groupings are important for identifying regional disparities in mortality, supporting local health planning, and targeting interventions where they are most needed. They also enable comparisons between areas and help monitor changes over time.

For example, within England and Wales these groupings include:

- Country: England and Wales (combined or separately).
- Region: The nine English regions and Wales.
- Local authority: Upper and lower tier local authorities.
- Health geographies: Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), former Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), and NHS regions.
- Urban/rural classification: Based on the 2011 Rural-Urban Classification.
- Deprivation: Using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintiles.

# Weekly, Monthly and Annual Mortality Analysis

Mortality data may be broken down by different time intervals, each suited to different types of analysis:

- **Weekly deaths:** Based on the date of registration. Useful for monitoring short-term changes and identifying sudden shifts in mortality patterns. Some years contain 53 weeks instead of the usual 52, depending on how the calendar falls.
- **Monthly deaths:** Also based on registration date. These provide a more stable view of trends than weekly data and are useful for monitoring medium-term changes.
- **Annual deaths:** Can be based on either registration or occurrence date. Annual data are used for long-term trend analysis and are typically more complete. Occurrence-based data may be delayed for certain causes of death, such as suicides or deaths referred to a coroner.
  **Note on Week Numbering**
  A year will contain 53 weeks if 1 January falls on a Thursday, or if it is a leap year and 1 January falls on a Wednesday. This should be considered when comparing weekly data across years

# Data Linkage Examples

Mortality data can be enhanced through linking data with other administrative and health datasets. These linkages allow for more detailed analysis of mortality patternsand the factors influencing health outcomes.

**Case Study: HES-ONS Linked Mortality Data in England**
One key example of linking mortality data is the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and ONS Linked Mortality Data, produced in collaboration with NHS England.

**This dataset links:**

- HES inpatient records (admitted patient care)
- HES outpatient and A&E records
- ONS death registration records

**The linkage enables analysis of patient pathways and outcomes by connecting hospital activity with subsequent mortality. It includes:**

- All patients admitted to NHS hospitals in England since 1997
- Deaths registered in England and Wales
- Linkage based on NHS number, date of birth, sex, and postcode

**Uses of the Linked Dataset**

- Assessing mortality following hospital discharge
- Evaluating outcomes for specific procedures or conditions
- Monitoring trends in avoidable mortality
- Supporting health service planning and evaluation

**Data Coverage and Quality**

- The dataset includes over 100 million hospital records and millions of linked deaths.
- Linkage rates are high, particularly for inpatient records.
- Data are updated quarterly and available through NHS Digitalâ€™s Data Access Request Service (DARS).

**Note:** This section provides an example of how mortality data can be linked to other sources. Technical guidance on how to perform data linkage is covered in a separate unit.

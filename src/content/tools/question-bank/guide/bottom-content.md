### Step 1: Define Your Objectives

**Start by clarifying the purpose of your survey or assessment.**

**Ask yourself:**

- What is the main goal of the survey?
- Which topic areas are most relevant (e.g., health, well-being, demographics)?
- Who is your target population or audience?

Once you have this in mind, move to Step 2.

### Step 2: Begin with Demographics

Most surveys start by collecting demographic information. Use the Demographic Information theme to select relevant questions.

!TIP Tip: If you're surveying students or children, check the specific demographic themes tailored to those groups.

### Step 3: Select Relevant Themes

Next, choose the themes that align with your objectives. You can use all available themes or just a subset, depending on your surveyâ€™s scope.

### Step 4: Choose Questions and Responses

Go through your first selected theme and copy the most appropriate questions and response options.

!TIP Tip: Some questions offer multiple response formats, choose the one that best fits your context.

### Step 5: Repeat for Other Themes

Repeat the process from Step 4 for any additional themes that support your objectives. Again, copy the most suitable questions and responses.

### Step 6: Adapt and Refine

Now that you've selected your questions, adapt them as needed to suit your specific context or population.

### Step 7: Add Custom Questions

If needed, include additional questions that are not in the Question Bank but are important for your survey.

### Step 8: Add Closing Questions

Wrap up your survey with appropriate closing questions to thank participants or gather final thoughts.

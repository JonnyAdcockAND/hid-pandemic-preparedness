The Question Bank is a resource designed to support National Statistical Offices (NSOs) in LMICs to support rapid survey development during infectious disease outbreaks. It contains a curated selection of tested questions, organised by theme, with multiple variations and response options. Each question includes references to the studies in which it was used, along with relevant notes to guide application.

**This tool aims to:**

- Provide a reliable set of questions that generate high-quality data.
- Accelerate the process of designing new surveys in outbreak settings.
- Offer flexibility in how questions are phrased and answered.

It provides a standardised set of questions that can be adapted for use in household surveys, phone interviews, or rapid assessments. The goal is to enable evidence-based decision-making and effective public health responses by capturing key indicators related to health, behaviour, socio-economic impact, and access to services.

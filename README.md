# Pandemic Preparedness Tool

The Pandemic Preparedness Toolkit (PPT) is a five-year project (2023 â€“ 2028), funded by Wellcome, which aims to co-create a sustainable, online Toolkit that will build capacity for infectious disease surveillance in National Statistical Offices (NSOs). The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) is collaborating with NSOs and Delivery Partners within Argentina, Malawi, and Nepal to co-develop the Toolkit.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/nextjs?renderer=react) is used to develop and test UI components in isolation.

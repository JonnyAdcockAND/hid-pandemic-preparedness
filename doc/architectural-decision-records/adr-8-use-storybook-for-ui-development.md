# ADR-8: Use Storybook for UI development

## Related NFRs

[accessibility-1][1]

## Rationale

The choice of Storybook for the project's design system was made to ensure that components can be built and tested in isolation; this ensures UI modularity (which promotes a clean, maintainable code-base) and Quality Assurance. Developing our component library using Storybook allows us to make use of its accessibility tools \[[1]\] and serves as documentation that can be easily shared across the team, which will ensure design alignment.

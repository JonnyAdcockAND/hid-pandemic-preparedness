## Rationale

The GOV.UK Service Manual recommends that code should be made open from the start \[[1]\] and that any changes should be tracked \[[2]\]. Project source code is therefore stored in a public repository linked to the ONS Digital github organisation. This approach ensures ONS Digital administrators can manage access to the code going forward \[[3]\], and security best practices are followed as soon as the project has started.

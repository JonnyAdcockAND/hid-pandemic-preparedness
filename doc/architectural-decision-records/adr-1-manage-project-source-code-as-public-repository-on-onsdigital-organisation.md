## Rationale

The GOV.UK Service Manual recommends that code should be made open from the start<sup>[1]</sup> and that any changes should be tracked<sup>[2]</sup>. Project source code is therefore stored in a public repository linked to the ONS Digital github organisation. This approach ensures ONS Digital administrators can manage access to the code going forward<sup>[3]</sup>, and security best practices are followed as soon as the project has started.

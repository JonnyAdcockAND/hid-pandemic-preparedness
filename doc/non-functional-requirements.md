# Non-functional requirements

This page lists the non-functional requirements the application is designed to meet. They are taken from initial project documentation, requirements gathering conducted as part of the ADP00041 alpha scoping exercise and wider ONS requirements.

We are committing to comply with ONS Digital Services guidance and standards. This will ensure that the Pandemic Preparedness Toolkit will meet requirements if ONS infrastructure is chosen as a hosting option. Even if the tool is hosted elsewhere, complying with the guidance and standards provided allows us to show what we have developed complies with relevant legislation and is of good quality.

ONS Digital Services guidance and standards references the [GOV.UK Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) and the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) amongst others. Following a review of these guidelines, relevant non-functional requirements listed below were identified.

### Video

The requirements below are based on the YouTube recommended settings to ensure maximum compatibity. These requirements also closely match the settings required when [managing videos as assets using a CMS such as Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/integrate-video-with-contentful/). Following these requirements will ensure video content can be served either as assets from the CMS or via a video service such as YouTube or Vimeo.

Certain requirements around video size, resolution and colour depth have been chosen to ensure that video content is aligned with project sustainability goals.

# Non-functional requirements

This section lists the non-functional requirements the application is designed to meet. They are taken from initial project documentation, requirements gathering conducted as part of the ADP00041 alpha scoping exercise and wider ONS requirements.

We are committing to comply with ONS Digital Services guidance and standards. This will ensure that the Pandemic Preparedness Toolkit will meet requirements if ONS infrastructure is chosen as a hosting option. Even if the tool is hosted elsewhere, complying with the guidance and standards provided allows us to show what we have developed complies with relevant legislation and is of good quality.

ONS Digital Services guidance and standards references the [GOV.UK Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) and the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) amongst others.

Following a review of the guidelines above and overall project requirements, non-functional requirements were developed. They are split into the following categories:

 - [Accessibility](./accessibility.md)
 - [Availability](./availability.md)
 - [Compatibility](./compatibility.md)
 - [Content](./content.md)
 - [Development](./development.md)
 - [Performance and reliability](./performance-and-reliability.md)
 - [Privacy](./privacy.md)
 - [Search](./search.md)
 - [Security](./security.md)

The requirements below are based on the YouTube recommended settings to ensure maximum compatibity. These requirements also closely match the settings required when [managing videos as assets using a CMS such as Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/integrate-video-with-contentful/). Following these requirements will ensure video content can be served either as assets from the CMS or via a video service such as YouTube or Vimeo.

Certain requirements around video size, resolution and colour depth have been chosen to ensure that video content is aligned with project sustainability goals.

# Handling long form content

This is the output of the [ONSPPT-74](https://anddigitaltransformation.atlassian.net/browse/ONSPPT-74) spike ticket to investigate how we would handle long form content, and to develop some content guidelines based on what is found.

There is a need for the application to show long form content, perhaps up to 250 A4 pages long. The questions this spike aims to answer are:

- If content equivalent to the length of 250 A4 pages was presented on a single page, would it load in a reasonable timeframe?
- Would long form content provide a good user experience?
- Could long form content be provided and also meet the project availability and accessibility requirements?
- Are there any technical solutions we can put in place to ensure long form content can be presented effectively?

## How "big" is a 250 page document?

The project document Pandemic Preparedness Toolkit: Toolkit Outline and Structural Plan is a 218 page pdf. It contains text but also includes images and tables so seems representative of a large document that would be a resource provided by the application. This document has the following attributes:

- 218 pages
- 44,311 words in total including headings, captions etc
- 5 images
- An estimated 25 tables of data
- 1.6 MB file size

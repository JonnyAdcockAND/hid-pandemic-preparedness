# Audio content requirements

This is the output of the [ONSPPT-86](https://anddigitaltransformation.atlassian.net/browse/ONSPPT-86) spike ticket to investigate how we would manage audio only content.

There is a potential need for the application to provide audio-only content. The questions this spike aims to answer are:

- How would this audio content be managed as a media asset?
- Could users listen to content on their device with the screen locked?
- Could content be downloaded to playback later?

## Audio content

Audio content can be presented on a web page in a similar way as video. Depending on the file size, the audio would be loaded or streamed from source. As long as [`<audio>` html tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/audio) are used when presenting audio content, a UI for controlling the audio are made available by the browser. These controls can be styled to suit the overall application design.

Audio content can be encoded with many [different codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs) and contained within different formats (e.g. aac, mp3, ogg). Different codecs and formats suit different use cases.

Browsers don't all support the same audio codecs and formats so it's important to check compatibility. Most browsers allow the continued playback of audio content even if the device screen is locked.

## Accessibility considerations

A screen reader can normally automatically "read" text-based content as audio to assist users who have difficulty perceiving visual content, but it is not so straightforward making audio content accessible for users with a hearing impairment. [WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded) require that any audio content has an alternative format providing equivalent information so people who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding audio information for any reason can understand it. This would normally be a transcript of the audio.

This transcript could either be autogenerated using the service hosting the audio, or uploaded separately along with the audio file. Accessibility requirements also provide guidance on where this transcript should be made available in relation to the audio on the page.

## Translation considerations

Any audio content will require a separate file for each language supported with an associated localised transcript.

## Recommendations

### Use the correct codec and format for voice content

We assume that any audio content provided by the application will be voice content. To ensure audio files are as small as possible the [aac](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs#aac_advanced_audio_coding) or [opus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs#opus) audio codecs should be used. Audio files should be made available in [MP4](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Containers#mpeg-4_mp4) and [WebM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Containers#webm).

Using these codecs and containers will ensure the best cross-browser compatibility and most efficient file sizes.

### Follow the W3C accessibility considerations when creating audio content

As well as the WCAG 2.2 guidelines related to audio content, W3C also provides [accessibility considerations when producing audio content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/#audio). At a high level, these considerations include:

- Create high quality audio
- Use low or no background audio when recording speech
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Give people time to process information
- Use clear language

Following these guidelines when creating audio content will ensure content is as accessible as possible and meets guidelines.

### Present audio content together with a transcript and download option

To meet accessibility requirements, any audio content must have an accompanying transcript to assist users who cannot easily understand audio information. This transcript should be available close to where audio is embedded on the page. There should also be an option to download audio files for playback at a later time.

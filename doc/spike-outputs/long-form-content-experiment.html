      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>

      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <p>Our colour palettes have been designed to meet best practice guidelines for accessibility, including the WCAG.
        We
        encourage you to use these in your data visualisations, but be mindful of any branding your institution may
        have.

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented

        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large

        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>

      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>

        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>

      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>

        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>

        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>

      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>

        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite

      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to

        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many

      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in

        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary

        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This

        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels

      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to

        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many

      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in

        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary

        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This

        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels

      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to

        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many

      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in

        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary

        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This

        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels

      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to

        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many

      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in

        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary

        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This

        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels

      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to

        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many

      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in

        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary

        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This

        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool

        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).

        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users

        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels

      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>

        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid

        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility & Formatting General Principles</h2>
      <h3>Using colour</h3>
      <p>Effective use of colour in data visualisation helps the brain quickly identify differences and can aid
        interpretation. However, using the wrong colours, too many colours, or unnecessary colours, can have the
        opposite
        effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Think carefully before you introduce additional colours into a chart. Ask yourself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you really need the colours?</li>
        <li>Do they make your key message or messages clearer?</li>
        <li>The colours you use should be sufficiently unique in tone and contrast. They should also account for users
          with low vision and colour blindness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance below expands on how you can achieve this. Colour guidance on axes, chart labels, annotations, and
        gridlines is included in the Other Formatting Considerations section below.</p>
      <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
      <p>Colour should be used to enhance your data visualisation. You should use different colours when they help to
        highlight differences in the data, but they should ideally not be the only way you convey those differences.</p>
      <p><strong>The WCAG state that:</strong> 1.4.1. Use of colour</p>
      <p>Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. This means that you should help users
        understand charts without relying only on colour. To do this, you should avoid using legends in line charts and
        pie charts. Instead, label the categories and lines in your chart.</p>
      <p>
        If you need to use a legend for stacked or clustered bar charts, order the legend to match the categories as
        they
        appear in the chart. This does not completely solve the problem, but it can help users work out the series
        labels
        without relying only on colour.</p>
      <h5>Use the right number of colours</h5>
      <p>Some data visualisations, such as a simple bar chart with one independent and one dependent variable, only need
        one colour across categories. The user is much more likely to compare the bars when they look alike than when
        they
        look different. Sometimes it is helpful to highlight a specific category to bring it into focus. In these cases,
        use one colour for this category (for example, dark blue), while keeping the others the same (for example,
        grey).
      </p>
      <p>Other types of data visualisation, such as a clustered bar chart, or a line graph showing multiple time series,
        are likely to benefit from having multiple colours. However, you should avoid using more than five colours in
        the
        same chart. Having more than five colours makes it harder for users to distinguish between categories.</p>
      <p>When people look at a chart with lots of colours, they try to work out what those different colours mean. If
        your
        colours suggest meanings that are not there the user will waste time and effort trying to understand them. This
        creates cognitive burden on the user and makes it harder for them to engage with your analysis.</p>
      <p>can make its content difficult to see. Data visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to
        fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h4>Consider associations</h4>
      <p>Colours come with their own symbolic associations. Think about these when choosing your palette. Consider
        whether
        your colours are appropriate. If done well, you can exploit these associations to help your users understand
        your
        visualisation more quickly.</p>
      <p>For example, people tend to link blue with water and green with grass. Using these types of links in data
        visualisations can help people understand information faster. If you use colours that go against these
        associations, it might take users longer to understand your chart. For example, it</p>
      <p>would take users longer to understand you were talking about grass if you used the colour red to represent it.
        Colours can also have cultural associations that we react to consciously or unconsciously. These associations
        vary
        across countries and groups. Make sure you investigate any possible associations first if you are sharing your
        data visualisations with international audiences.</p>
      <p>f shades of a similar colour are used across categories in a chart, users may assume they are related. If your
        data has distinct (i.e. discrete or unrelated) categories, then you should use distinct colours.</p>
      <h5>Keep your colour palettes consistent</h5>
      <p>If you have multiple data visualisations in a publication, assign the same colour to the same categories in
        each
        one. If you change the way you use colours in a series of charts it becomes harder for users to follow the
        story.
        It can also cause them to mistake one data series for another, especially if a user is skim reading.</p>
      <h4>Consider contrast ratios</h4>
      <p>Although differences in tone (for example, red, green, and blue) can make your colours distinguishable for many
        users, this may not be enough for users with colour-blindness. One of the best ways we can account for users
        with
        colour-blindness is via the use of contrast, which is typically measured via contrast ratios.</p>
      <p>Effective use of contrast also ensures that your visualisations are readable if, for example, it is printed in
        black and white. It may be helpful to switch your display settings to greyscale to test whether you can identify
        differences, whether you have colour-blindness or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Contrast ratios range between 1:1 (white on white) and 21:1 (black on white).</strong> Generally, a
        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>

        moderate level of contrast is the most desirable, but the WCAG include specific thresholds you should aim to
        pass
        at minimum.</p>
      <p>There are two success criteria in the WCAG that refer to contrast ratios: 1.4.11.</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of parts of graphics required to understand the content have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        3 to 1 against adjacent colours except when a particular presentation is essential. This means that all chart
        elements (such as categories in a bar chart) must have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours,
        unless
        the presentation is essential for communicating your key message. 1.4.3. Contrast (minimum)</p>
      <p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large
        scale
        text which needs to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This means you should make sure that all chart labels
        and annotations have at least a 4.5: contrast ratio with the background colour.</p>
      <p>Large scale text; is defined as at least 18 point regular or 14 point bold. However, when charts are presented
        as
        images, the text size often changes. It is therefore always best to aim for a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. To go even
        further, WCAG success criterion 1.4.6 states that text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at
        least
        7:1. As a level AAA criterion, this would meet and then exceed legal requirements in the UK.</p>
      <p>Never use an image as a background to your data visualisation. This can make its content difficult to see. Data
        visualisations that use an image as a background are also likely to fail accessibility criteria from WCAG.</p>
      <h5>Calculate a contrast ratio</h5>
      <p>To calculate the contrast ratio between two colours to check if they meet these requirements, use our tool
        below.
        You will need to find the HEX codes of your colours first. To do so in Microsoft programmes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the graphical element or object of interest</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Format’ ribbon</li>
        <li>Select the ‘Shape Fill’ dropdown</li>
        <li>Select ‘More Fill Colours’</li>
        <li>Select ‘Custom’</li>
        <li>If your background colour is white, the hex code for white is: #FFFFFF.</li>
        <li>Read off the hex code (it starts with a hashtag symbol (#))</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then insert the HEX codes into our tool, and compare the outputted ratio to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

      <p>Our colour palettes have been designed to meet best practice guidelines for accessibility, including the WCAG.
        We
        encourage you to use these in your data visualisations, but be mindful of any branding your institution may
        have.
